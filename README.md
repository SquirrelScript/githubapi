#Api Challenge

Create a single page app which allows you to enter a github user name and retrieve and display a list of the user's repos and followers.

You will need a back end and a front end.  Please upload your repos onto your github accounts and post links on https://squirrelscript.slack.com/messages/apichallenge/
